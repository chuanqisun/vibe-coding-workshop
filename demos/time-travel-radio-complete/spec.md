# Time Travel Speech Synthesis Demo - Specification

## Overview

An interactive web application that combines the Web Speech API with a time travel concept, allowing users to hear era-appropriate content spoken aloud as they slide through different time periods from 1920 to 2025.

## Core Features

### 1. Time Travel Slider

- **Range**: 1920 to 2025
- **Step**: 1 year increments
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time year display with current year highlighting
- **Behavior**: Automatically updates content and triggers speech synthesis

### 2. Era-Specific Content

Pre-written historical content for key decades:

- **1920**: Jazz age, prohibition, women's suffrage
- **1930**: Great Depression, radio shows, talking pictures
- **1940**: World War II, swing music, resilience
- **1950**: Rock and roll, television, suburbia
- **1960**: Civil rights, space exploration, The Beatles
- **1970**: Disco, environmental awareness, early computers
- **1980**: MTV, neon culture, personal computers
- **1990**: Internet emergence, grunge music, digital transition
- **2000**: New millennium, Y2K, digital age
- **2010**: Social media, smartphones, streaming
- **2020**: Pandemic era, remote work, TikTok

### 3. Automatic Speech Synthesis

- **Auto-Stop**: Immediately cancels current speech when slider moves
- **Auto-Start**: Automatically begins speaking new content after 200ms delay
- **Smart Timeout**: Prevents audio overlap during rapid sliding
- **Era-Appropriate Voice Effects**:
  - Pre-1950: Slower rate (0.8x), higher pitch (1.2x) for vintage radio effect
  - 1950-1980: Slightly modified voice (0.9x rate, 1.1x pitch)
  - Post-1980: Normal modern voice settings

### 4. User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface with card-based layout
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear time period indicators and status messages
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Play/Stop buttons with emoji icons
  - Disabled state management
  - Real-time status updates
- **Accessibility**: Proper labeling and keyboard support (Ctrl+Enter to speak)

## Technical Implementation

### Web APIs Used

- **Web Speech API**: `speechSynthesis` for text-to-speech conversion
- **DOM API**: Range input slider, event listeners
- **Browser Compatibility**: Graceful degradation with error messaging

### Key JavaScript Functions

- `updateContent(year)`: Manages content switching and auto-play logic
- `resetButtons()`: UI state management
- Event handlers for slider input/change events
- Speech synthesis configuration and error handling

### Performance Optimizations

- Timeout management prevents multiple overlapping speech instances
- Efficient closest-year algorithm for undefined years
- Minimal DOM manipulation with targeted updates

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Defaults to year 2000 with welcome content
2. **Slider Interaction**:
   - User drags slider to any year
   - Current speech immediately stops
   - Content updates to match selected era
   - New speech automatically begins after brief delay
3. **Manual Controls**: Users can also manually start/stop speech
4. **Error Handling**: Browser compatibility checks and user feedback

## Browser Support

- **Required**: Web Speech API support
- **Fallback**: Error messaging for unsupported browsers
- **Enhanced Experience**: Works best in Chrome/Edge with full speech synthesis support
