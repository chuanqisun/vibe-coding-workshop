In this workshop, you will participate in a role-playing game to gain first-hand experience designing with generative AI.

### Learning goals

1. Understanding the concept of prompting
2. Become familiar with the current vibe coding practice
3. Allow more experienced students to teach less experienced students
4. Inspire curiosity around technology
5. Faciliate group formation

### Format

- Before workshop: students should gain access to LLM coding tools
- Intro: 10 minutes talk that motivates vibe coding, outlining its short-coming, and highlights its advantage in prototyping.
- Demo: 10 minutes live demo of the main activity, done by TAs or instructors
- Main activity: 35 minutes - 1 hour
  - Round One: 15 minutes. People with more LLM coding experience should play the roles of the AI (see role guide)
  - Round Two: 15 minutes. Rotate the roles to allow people to play roles they are less familiar with.
- Show and tell: 5 - 20 minutes, allow at least 3 mintues per group
- After workshop: survey to gauge learning and collect feedback

### Group Objective

Work together to simulate a human-AI vibe coding session where the human uses AI to build a website about their award winning design project.

The end result can be:

1. Public URL for apps built in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
2. Chat transcript
3. Screenshot for apps built with VSCode, Cursor

### Group Formation

Players: 2-5 people per group. The recommended group size is 4-5 people.

Make sure your group has at least one person with LLM coding experience. If your group has fewer people, you can combine the roles of note taker, browser, and code editor.

- **Player 1: You are you.** Plays as themselves. Their goal is to ask the "AI" for help.
- **Player 2: You are ChatGPT.** Role-plays the main chat interface (like ChatGPT).
- **Player 3: You are ChatGPT's memory.** Observes the interaction and takes notes, acting as the AI's memory.
- **Player 4: You are Google Chrome.** Acts as the AI's ability to browse the web.
- **Player 5: You are Code editor.** Acts as the AI's ability to write and edit code. This person controls an AI coding tool. LLM coding experience recommended.

### Role Guide

**Player 1: You are you**

- Goal: Chat with the “AI” to build a website that tells the story of your award-winning tangible interface design project. The final result should be a working website that tells a stunning story.
- Example starter prompt: "Hi GPT, can you help me build a website about my award-winning design project?"
- Rules:
  - Utilize the web browsing and coding capabilities.
  - Speak as if you are talking to ChatGPT.
  - Provide real, useful information to the “AI”.

**Player 2: You are ChatGPT**

- Rules:
  - Speak as if you are ChatGPT. Follow your system prompt.
  - Role-play reasonably. Mild hallucination and refusing poor user input is okay.
- Your System Prompt: "Be a helpful chat assistant to help the user with their task. Make plans and think out loud while reasoning. You have access to a notepad, a web browser, and a code editor. Use those tools wisely to help the user accomplish their goal."

**Player 3: You are ChatGPT's memory**

- Rules:
  - Follow ChatGPT's command to note down key points brought up by the user or seen in the browser
  - Allow anyone to look at your notes, including the human
  - Use your notes to inform ChatGPT's responses

**Player 4: You are Google Chrome**

- Rules:
  - Follow ChatGPT's command to perform web browsing related tasks
  - Allow anyone to look at your browser content, including the human
  - Use your browser content to inform ChatGPT's responses

**Player 5: You are Code editor**

- Rules:
  - Follow ChatGPT's command to perform code generation and debugging tasks
  - Use any AI code editor you are familiar with
  - Share your screen with other players, including the human

### Breaking the Fourth Wall

If the group gets stuck, it’s okay to break the fourth wall. Step out of your character, discuss with your group, and help each other get back on track.
